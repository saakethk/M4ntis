# Backend Server
This is the code to expose the backend code like the FPGA interface and such to the frontend website.

## Endpoints
- /symbols?q=[query]&limit=[limit]
  - query: user can search either a symbol or stock
  - limit: the max number of results to return
  - result: output a list of the relevant results
- POST /auth/register and POST /auth/login with `{ "email", "password" }`
  - sets an HttpOnly `session` cookie for 14 days
- POST /auth/logout clears that cookie
- GET /auth/me returns the signed-in user
